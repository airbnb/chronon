"""
This GroupBy aggregates clicks by the ad_id primary key, and it is setup to resemble a streaming GroupBy.

Normally, the source for a Streaming GroupBY would look something like:

EventSource(
    table="logging.clicks_event"
    topic="kafka_topic_for_click",
    ...)

However, in this case we're working with Static CSV data, so we don't have the right table/topics to set this up.

Instead, we're going to use the same output table from the staging query to perform the feature computation. Because it has all of
the fields that we care about (`ad_id`, `clicked`, and `ts` columns), it will mimic the offline data source correctly.
