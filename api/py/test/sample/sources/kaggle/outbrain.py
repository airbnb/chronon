Sources allow one-to-one transformations (i.e. row level transformations like ROUND, IF, etc.), but no joins (for this you must use a StagingQuery) or Aggregation (these occur in GroupBy).

Sources are used as components in GroupBys (which can define aggregations on top of a source for a given primary key), or as the left side of a Join.
