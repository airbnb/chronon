    External sources are online only data sources. During fetching, using

    java client library that can be used to fetch a batch of External source

    Internally Chronon will batch these requests to the service and parallelize
    fetching from different services, while de-duplicating given a batch of
    join requests.

    label data instead of regular feature data. Once labels are mature, label join job would join
    labels with features in the training window user specified using `leftStartOffset` and
    `leftEndOffset`.

    The offsets are relative days compared to given label landing date `label_ds`. This parameter is required to be
    passed in for each label join job. For example, given `label_ds = 2023-04-30`, `left_start_offset = 30`, and
    `left_end_offset = 10`, the left size start date will be computed as 30 days before `label_ds` (inclusive),

    [2023-04-01, 2023-04-21] in this specific label job run.

    Since label join job will run continuously based on the schedule, multiple labels could be generated but with
    different label_ds or label version. Label join job would have all computed label versions available, as well as
    a view of latest version for easy label retrieval.

    LabelPart definition can be updated along the way, but label join job can only accommodate these changes going
    forward unless a backfill is manually triggered.

    Bootstrap is the concept of using pre-computed feature values and skipping backfill computation during the
    training data generation phase. Bootstrap can be used for many purposes:
    - Generating ongoing feature values from logs
    - Backfilling feature values for external features (in which case Chronon is unable to run backfill)
    - Initializing a new Join by migrating old data from an older Join and reusing data

    One can bootstrap against any of these:
    - join part fields:
        Bootstrap can happen at individual field level within a join part.
        If all fields within a group by are bootstrapped, then we skip computation for group by. Otherwise, the whole
        thing will be re-run but only the values for the non-bootstrapped fields will be retained in the final table.
    - external part fields:
        Bootstrap can happen at individual field level within an external part.
        Since there is no backfill logic in chronon for external part, all non-bootstrapped fields in external parts
        are left as NULLs.
    - derivation fields:
        Derived fields can also be bootstrapped. Since derived fields depend on "base" fields (either join part or
        external part), chronon will try to trigger the least amount of computation possible. For example,
        if there is a join part where all derived fields that depend on the join part have been bootstrapped,
        then we skip the computation for this join part.
    - keys:
        Keys of both join parts and external parts can be bootstrapped. During offline table generation, we will first
        try to utilize key's data from left table; if it's not there, then we utilize bootstrap.
        For contextual features, we also support propagating the key bootstrap to the values.

    :param online_external_parts:
        users can register external sources into Api implementation. Chronon fetcher can invoke the implementation.
        This is applicable only for online fetching. Offline this will not be produce any values.
    :param offline_schedule:
        Cron expression for Airflow to schedule a DAG for offline join compute tasks
    :param row_ids:
        Columns of the left table that uniquely define a training record. Used as default keys during bootstrap
    :param bootstrap_parts:
        A list of BootstrapPart used for the Join. See BootstrapPart doc for more details
    :param bootstrap_from_log:
        If set to True, will use logging table to generate training data by default and skip continuous backfill.
        Logging will be treated as another bootstrap source, but other bootstrap_parts will take precedence.
    :param label_part:
        Label part which contains a list of labels and label refresh window boundary used for the Join
    :param tags:
        Additional metadata about the Join that you wish to track. Does not effect computation.
    :type tags: Dict[str, str]
    :param historical_backfill:
        Flag to indicate whether join backfill should backfill previous holes.
        Setting to false will only backfill latest single partition
    :type historical_backfill: bool
    :return:
        A join object that can be used to backfill or serve data. For ML use-cases this should map 1:1 to model.
