/**
 * Custom Trigger that fires at most every 'bufferSizeMillis' within a window. This Trigger intended for incremental
 * window aggregations using event-time semantics.
 *
 * Purpose: This trigger exists as an optimization to reduce the number of writes to our online store and better handle
 * contention that arises from having hot keys.
 *
 * Details:
 *  - The buffer timers are NOT aligned with the UNIX Epoch, they can fire at any timestamp. e.g., if the first
 *  event arrives at 14ms, and the buffer size is 100ms, the timer will fire at 114ms.
 *  - Buffer timers are only scheduled when events come in. If there's a gap in events, this trigger won't fire.
 *
 * Edge cases handled:
 * - If the (event-time) window closes before the last (processing-time) buffer fires, this trigger will fire
 * the remaining buffered elements before closing.
 *
 * Example:
 *    Window size = 300,000 ms (5 minutes)
 *    BufferSizeMillis = 100 ms.
 *    Assume we are using this trigger on a GroupBy that counts the number unique IDs see.
 *    For simplicity, assume event time and processing time are synchronized (although in practice this is never true)
 *
 *    Event 1: ts = 14 ms, ID = A.
 *        preAggregate (a Set that keeps track of all unique IDs seen) = [A]
 *        this causes a timer to be set for timestamp = 114 ms.
 *    Event 2: ts = 38 ms, ID = B.
 *        preAggregate = [A, B]
 *    Event 3: ts = 77 ms, ID = B.
 *        preAggregate = [A, B]
 *    Timer set for 114ms fires.
 *        we emit the preAggregate [A, B].
 *    Event 4: ts = 400ms, ID = C.
 *        preAggregate = [A,B,C] (we don't purge the previous events when the time fires!)
 *        this causes a timer to be set for timestamp = 500 ms
 *    Timer set for 500ms fires.
 *        we emit the preAggregate [A, B, C].
