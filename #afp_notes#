What trust does very well?
Data ownership
Label joins
Feature drift monitoring
Feature quality
Service call features
What zipline(v21) does well?
Feature backfills (aggregations, windowing etc on large data)
Real time feature refresh.
Low latency serving
Training-serving skew measurement (OOC).
There are still gaps:
Sharing & reuse
Lineage information - what other models use a feature I want to re-use, where does the underlying data for this feature come from?
Show feature correlation
show feature importance (needs model integration)
Latency and throughput metrics (current values)
In the future automatically recommend features
Multi level features
Embeddings - need to be async (write side computed)
Should be easy to compose embeddings over towers of models
Zipline team tends to think of gaps from a v21 perspective. Trust team tends to think of gaps from v2 perspective. So there is friction when communicating. (edited)
