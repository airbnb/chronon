# Chronon: A Feature Platform for AI/ML

Chronon is a platform that abstracts away the complexity of data computation and serving for AI/ML applications. Users define features as transformation of raw data, then Chronon can perform batch and streaming computation, scalable backfills, low-latency serving, guaranteed correctness and consistency, as well as a host of observability and monitoring tools.

It allows you to utilize all of the data within your organization to power your AI/ML projects, without needing to worry about all the complex orchestration that this would usually entail.

## Benefits of Chronon over other approaches

Chronon offers the most value to AI/ML practitioners who are trying to build "online" models that are serving requests in real-time as opposed to batch workflows.

Without Chronon, engineers working on these projects need to figure out how to get data to their models for training/eval as well as production inference. As the complexity of data going into these models increases (multiple sources, complex transformation such as windowed aggregations, etc), so does the infrastructure challenge of supporting this data plumbing.

Generally, we observed ML practitioners taking one of two approaches:

### The log-and-wait approach

With this approach, users start with the data that is available in the online serving environment from which the model inference will run. Log relevant features to the data warehouse. Once enough data has accumulated, train the model on the logs, and serve with the same data.

Pros:
- Features used to train the model are guaranteed to be available at serving time
- The model can access service call features 
- The model can access data from the the request context


Cons:
- It might take a long to accumulate enough data to train the model
- Performing windowed aggregations is not always possible (running large range queries against production databases doesn't scale, same for event streams)
- Cannot utilize the wealth of data already in the data warehouse
- Maintaining data transformation logic in the application layer is messy

### The replicate offline-online approach

With this approach, users train the model with data from the data warehouse, then figure out ways to replicate those features in the online environment.

Pros:
- You can use a broad set of data for training
- The data warehouse is well suited for large aggregations and other computationally intensive transformation

Cons:
- Often very error prone, resulting in inconsistent data between training and serving
- Requires maintaining a lot of complicated infrastructure to even get started with this approach, 
- Serving features with realtime updates gets even more complicated, especially with large windowed aggregations
- Unlikely to scale well to many models

**The Chronon approach** 

With Chronon you can use any data available in your organization, including everything in the data warehouse, any streaming source, service calls, etc, with guaranteed consistency between online and offline environments. It abstracts away the infrastructure complexity of orchestrating and maintining this data plumbing, so that users can simply define features in a simple API, and trust Chronon to handle the rest.

## Platform Features

### Online Serving

Chronon offers an API for realtime fetching which returns up-to-date values for your features. It supports:

- Managed pipelines for batch and realtime feature computation and updates to the serving backend
- Low latency serving of computed features 
- Scalable for high fanout feature sets

### Backfills 

ML practitioners often need historical views of feature values for model training and evaluation. Chronon's backfills are:

- Scalable for large time windows
- Resilient to highly skewed data
- Point-in-time accurate such that consistency with online serving is guaranteed

### Observability, monitoring and data quality

Chronon offers visibility into:

- Data freshness - ensure that online values are being updated in realtime
- Online/Offline consistency - ensure that backfill data for model training and evaluation is consistent with what is being observed in online serving 

### Complex transformations and windowed aggregations

Chronon supports a range of aggregation types. For a full list see the documentation (here)[https://chronon.ai/Aggregations.html].

These aggregations can all be configured to be computed over arbitrary window sizes.

## Examples

Below are some simple code examples meant to illustrate the main APIs that Chronon offers. These examples are based off the code in Getting Started, please see that section for more details on how to actually run these.
