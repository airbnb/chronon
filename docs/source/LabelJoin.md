# Label Join

## API Example
**Generate training data by combining features & labels**

```python
"""
:param labels: List of labels
:param left_start_offset: Relative integer to define the earliest date label should be refreshed
compared to label_ds date specified. For labels with aggregations,
    this param has to be same as aggregation window size.
:param left_end_offset: Relative integer to define the most recent date(inclusive) label should be refreshed.
e.g. left_end_offset = 3 most recent label available will be 3 days
prior to 'label_ds' (including `label_ds`). For labels with aggregations, this param
has to be same as aggregation window size.
:param label_offline_schedule: Cron expression for Airflow to schedule a DAG for offline
label join compute tasks
"""

my_model = Join(
   ...,
   # Define label table and add it to the training set 
   label_part=LabelPart(
      labels=[JoinPart(group_by=GroupBy(
         name="my_label",
         sources=[HiveEntitySource(
            namespace="db_name",
            table="<my_label_table>",
            query=Query(selects=select(
               label_col="label_col",
               entity_id="entity_id"))
         )],
         aggregations=None,
         keys=["<entity_id>"]
      ))],
      left_start_offset=30,
      left_end_offset=0,
   )
)
```

## How does label join work?
Including a label_part to your join now creates a new set of workflows to create label tables and a labeled training
set view for the join. Internally, chronon (1) joins the label source table with the left table to create a materialized
label table, and (2) maintains a Hive view that joins the materialized label table (which doesnâ€™t have feature data)
with the feature table. The (2) result is not materialized for cost efficiency consideration. Label join will also have
a dedicated DAG for label computation. In another word, for offline pipelines, you will have two workflows, one for join
backfill and the other for label join job.

## What do output tables look like?
```
 # output tables
 # 1. Regular join feature backfill table
 # 2. Joined view with features and labels. On the fly and not materialized
 # 3. Joined view with feature and latest labels available. On the fly and not materialized
 my_team_my_join_v1 
 my_team_my_join_v1_labeled
 my_team_my_join_v1_labeled_latest

# sample schema of my_team_my_join_v1_labeled
